# Virtual Keyboards on Wayland

Virtual keyboards, also called on-screen keyboards (OSKs), is a piece of
software that allows a user to input keys via a touchscreen or a mouse
interface, instead of a physical keyboard.

Broadly speaking, OSKs can be split into two categories:

- Mobile keyboards, primarily for portrait screens, more focussed on
simple text input, like what would be found on Android or iOS as default.
- Desktop keyboards, primarily for landscape screens or larger screens,
more focussed on controlling a computer to it's fullest extent, including
use of modifier keys and keybinds.

Note that these categories are flexible, and just mainly serve as an example
of categorisation of OSKs. Others that could exist are simple/advanced and 
touchscreen/mouse, as examples.

In this document I'll outline what each are typically used for, some notes
on what Wayland currently has in place for implementations, some
requirements for both protocol + compositor-side and application-side
developers (application-side devs here being the ones working on OSKs on
Wayland), and finally some examples of those keyboards (mainly Wayland, some X).

## Common Misconceptions

- OSKs aren't just primarily for touchscreens, they should be able to be used
effectively with mice and other pointer methods as well. This means that some
aspects of an OSK's design need to be examined from multiple angles, such as
the amount of screen estate that the OSK takes up, as touchscreen OSKs should
take up enough for the fingers of user to be able to accurately use the OSK,
but mouse users have typically higher precision, so they may prefer a smaller
amount of screen estate to be taken up

## Mobile Keyboards

Mobile keyboards are typically used to input text in an efficient and
user-friendly manner, with less concern on more specialised input. They
more frequently are found on touchscreen devices, especially ones with
portrait modes.

Android and iOS keyboards are what I would consider to be the gold
standard, and we should probably seek to reproduce how they work.

Note that I don't include something like
[Hacker's Keyboard](https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard), as that
contains more specialised keyboard features, such as modifier keys.

### Mobile OSK Use-cases

- Texting / messaging
- Simple note writing
- Dialling a phone number

### Mobile OSK Implementation Details

- You will want to look into preediting/commiting strings using a protocol
like [input-method-unstable-v1.xml](https://wayland.app/protocols/input-method-unstable-v1)

### Mobile OSK Requirements

- Displays on the lower half of the screen
- Ability to switch layers to access numbers & symbols
- Spell-checking (Optional)
- Mobile keyboards usually appear only when a text input is selected

### Mobile OSK Examples

- Maliit
- Squeekboard

## Desktop Keyboards

Desktop keyboards are typically used to emulate a full keyboard,
including usually having a GUI that shows a keyboard layout, complete
with special keys, modifier keys and levels.

They are usually less focussed on text-specific input, and allow the user
to input keybinds and other specialised input to control their computer.

I find that desktop OSKs are more useful when the input method is a mouse.

### Desktop OSK Use-cases

- For use on screens where the keyboard should not take up large amounts
of screen estate, such as on a touchscreen TVs or projector systems
- Navigating programs using non-text input, e.g. special keys, keybinds
  - Desktop Environments / Compositors
  - Terminal (to send SIG events, e.g. `Ctrl+C`)
  - Spreadsheet Program (More advanced text editing, home/end keys, etc)
  - Games (using something like the arrow keys)
- Using the OSK as a GUI keyboard macro pad

### Desktop OSK Implementation Details

- Requires a protocol that enables sending key events
- I have found that the documentation around what keymaps is a tad lacking,
see [the Xkbcommon docs](https://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/xkbcommon-keysyms_8h.html)

### Desktop OSK Requirements

- Ability to float
- Ability to emulate a full hardware keyboard (including modifier keys)
- Ability to change the window's opacity
- Ability to be shown even when there isn't a text input active
(i.e. an always shown setting)
- Support for differing key sizes (touchscreen users need bigger keys,
whereas mice users need smaller keys so they can still see most of the
screen)

### Desktop OSK Examples

- [Onboard](https://launchpad.net/onboard) (X11,
this is my personal go-to virtual keyboard)
- [vboard](https://github.com/archisman-panigrahi/vboard): Supports both KDE and GNOME via uinput.

### OSKs

- [Awesome-Wayland's OSK Links](https://github.com/rcalixte/awesome-wayland?tab=readme-ov-file#on-screen-keyboards)
- [Maliit-Keyboard](https://maliit.github.io/)

- [QVK](https://invent.kde.org/apol/qvk) (More of a demo in it's current state, 2024/12/06)

### Other Tips

- KDE exposes the [input-method-unstable-v1.xml](https://wayland.app/protocols/input-method-unstable-v1)
(contrary to what the page claims), but it's hidden to applications by
default. You need to add `X-KDE-Wayland-VirtualKeyboard=true` into the
applications `.desktop` file that is installed in the applications directory,
`/usr/share/applications`, for KDE to accept it, and then it'll be available
to select in System Settings.
